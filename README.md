// User Story

As an employer, 
I want to be able to access applicants' 
profiles quickly and easily. 

//How it works

The user will be prompted with two questions. 

1. What is your GitHub username?
2. What is your favorite color?

The user will answer these questions. 
The index.js will grab the input and generate
a profile on a PDF. 

The index.js grabs the GitHub username that was inputed
and displays it on the PDF. It also grabs the color 
and changes the colors on the PDF.
